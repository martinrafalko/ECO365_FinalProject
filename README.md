Have to install the package "alphavantager" for it to run. Made and ran in RStudio. Likely won't work on replit. Change the value of x to a stock ticker symbol to analyze. This program checks for the combination of a positive aroon value and positive a/d value(bullish), both being negative(bearish) or neither(neutral). Finding a "bullish" stock is difficult but possible. Most stocks I've looked up have been "neutral" or "bearish."  This program is not meant for the purpose of providing investment advice. 

Aroon has an "up" value and a "down" value. If the Aroon-Up crosses above the Aroon-Down, then a new uptrend may start soon. Conversely, if Aroon-Down crosses above the Aroon-Up, then a new downtrend may start.

A/D has either a positive or negative value. The value uses volume and price to assess whether a stock is being accumulated or distributed.

The Aroon indicator is a technical indicator that is used to identify trend changes in the price of an asset, as well as the strength of that trend. In essence, the indicator measures the time between highs and the time between lows over a time period. The idea is that strong uptrends will regularly see new highs, and strong downtrends will regularly see new lows. The indicator signals when this is happening, and when it isn't. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aroon.asp#:~:text=advisor%20(CTA).-,What%20Is%20the%20Aroon%20Indicator%3F,lows%20over%20a%20time%20period.

The accumulation/distribution indicator (A/D) is a cumulative indicator that uses volume and price to assess whether a stock is being accumulated or distributed. The A/D measure seeks to identify divergences between the stock price and the volume flow. This provides insight into how strong a trend is. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accumulationdistribution.asp#:~:text=The%20accumulation%2Fdistribution%20indicator%20(A%2FD)%20is%20a,how%20strong%20a%20trend%20is.
